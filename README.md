This project tackles a raw, unlabeled dataset (mystery_dataset_complex.csv) designed to 
simulate real-world data chaos â€” with missing values, mixed types, embedded JSON, and no 
column names. 

Our goal is to decode its structure, clean and normalize the data, uncover meaningful patterns 
through EDA, apply clustering, and build a simple interactive dashboard to present key insights.
